# Interactive R1rho Relaxtion Dispersion Profiles

This script generates an interactive simulated NMR relaxation diserpsion (R1rho) data profile. The simulated data is generated by solving the Bloch-McConnell differential equations decribing chemcial exchange in an external magnetic field.

The purpose of this module is to allow the user to explore how changes in the 'ground state' and 'excited state' kinetics, thermodynamics, and topology will manifest experimentally.
